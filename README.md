## Overview
### Description
Tracks various daily activities and journaling and organizational tools, and populates a personal feed that is displayed to and reviewable by the user. Allows users to create custom journal entries, reminders, and data tracking entries and categorizes them. Designed for individual use, with potential for social-media style feeds of information users want to make public.

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Organization / Productivity
- **Mobile:** This app would be primarily developed for mobile but would perhaps be just as viable on a computer. Functionality wouldn't be limited to mobile devices, however mobile version could potentially have more features.
- **Story:** Allows for dynamic journaling and tracking of categorical to-do lists, and for users to create and update personal reminders in one location for a streamlined user experience.
- **Market:** Any individual could choose to use this app, presumably those who are organization and productivity minded, like professionals, students, etc.
- **Habit:** This app would presumably be used daily as a means of tracking adherence to personal goals.
- **Scope:** First we would start with getting users familiarized with having their own centralized productivity resource, and then it could be expanded to a news-feed style application with public facing profiles, or some research-based application that could help identify areas that individuals are struggling to reach their ideal productivity or outcomes, and notify users of potentially helpful resources or modified goals.
